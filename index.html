        <h2>Who is Kexin Liu</h2>
        <p>My name is Kexin Liu, and I am an 18-year-old girl. My English name is Grace.</p>
        <p>I was born in Luoyang, Henan Province, China. Luoyang is a beautiful city where is the ancient capital of thirteen dynasties and it is famous because of peonies. There are four members in my family, my father, my mother, my younger brother and I. Seriously, I do not want to leave them, but they all support my decision. Therefore, I really love them especially my cute brother who is only 4 years old.</p>
        <p>I have many hobbies such as listening to music, watching movies, traveling and hanging out with my friends. Of course, I like many celebrities like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Ed Sheeran and so on. I hope one day I can go their concerts. In my spare time, I like play with my brother or chat with my friends. To be honest, I do not like reading and writing, but I have to do that for my study.</p>
        <p>Now, I am a student at UGA. I do not decide my major yet. I think it may be accounting, because accountant is easy to find a job. Also, if I choose this major, I can help my father to run his business. The reason of I come to UGA is that it has diverse majors and it has the wonderful business college. I hope I can have more wonderful experiences and more useful opportunities here, and I want take better education for exceeding myself.</p>

        <h2>The Most Impressive Experience For Kexin</h2>
        <p>The trip of America was the most impressive experience for me. I went to America with my best friend, and we went to several places, such as Washington, New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. I gradually figured out that Americans tended to lead a fast-paced lifestyle. We visited some famous universities and felt the atmosphere of the different, higher educations. We also traveled to the Universal Studios, and we felt it was an amazing place where we were able to feel like a movie star.</p>
        <p>After this trip, I fell in love with America. I had a goal that I want to study and take education in America since I figured out the American education, to some extent, is better than China, and American universities can provide a grateful study's environment for students. Moreover, different cities of America have different sceneries, and they all have their specialties and history. Traveling brings this dream to me, and it makes me knowledgeable.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Niche Pizza Co.</h3>
        <p>I worked at the Niche Pizza Co. in Tate. During this work, I make a lot of friends and learn how to communicate with colleague and customer. The most important thing is that I get a skill that how to make and bake a pizza. The process of making a pizza is really interesting. People should first select the sause they prefer and then add the different cheeses. The next step is adding the meat and any vegatables they want. After they pay for the pizza, they can just wait we call them to get the pizza. I believe this is an important experience for me in my university's life. I love my work, making pizzas. </p>
